# Inukshuk Books

This is a fictitious product scenario from University of Alberta Software Product Management course. This is the capstone project. Crucial product related documents were created to simulate real-word environment in this scenario.

Summary of scenario: Inukshuk Books is a 21 year old book store with over 50 stores across Canada. They are looking to expand to the online market space, paticulary targeting young people, paticulary ages 7-12. There is correlation between reading and academic success that young readers who develop an interest in reading go on to doing well academically. The main purpose of this inititave is to try and increase interest in reading amongst young readers. They are looking to develop a product which delivers digital books to users upon request. The vision of this product is that it will help young readers improve their literacy while reading interesting content tailored towards them. Inukshuk Books have done research that suggests that peer to peer reading is the best way to improve a child's literacy and increase interest in reading. They are looking to include this somehow into the product.

There are no current competitors for this product. There are similar substitures such as an E-reader or educational tools but no product that combines the two. Inukshuk is looking to focus only on the North American market for now with a possibility to expand to other nations in the future. They are hoping to increase sales in next 5-10 years by increasing the number of children interested in reading and buying books.

Inukshuk is looking to launch the product, which is an app, in the next 6-8 weeks. They want a working prototype in 6 in weeks. The budget to achieve the goal of the product covers 3 developers and has contingency funds for additional resources or technology, if needed. 

As the product manager for this effort, I will work closely with an internal team consisting of 3 product developers, Inukshuk's in-house literacy expert and the COO of Inukshuk Books. I will drive the completion of an internal assessment which includes completetion of various documents listed below. I will lead the way to ensure the product management lifecycle is used to Inukshuk Books advantage.
